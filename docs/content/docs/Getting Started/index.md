title: What is catppuccin/nix?
---

`catppuccin/nix` is a port of the [soothing pastel theme](https://catppuccin.com) for [Nix](https://nixos.org).

To be more specific, we provide modules for NixOS and [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) that enable you to quickly and easily apply the Catppuccin colorscheme across over 70 applications. Each of these are hand-crafted and specifically designed for each app by a [wonderful community of contributors](https://catppuccin.com/community/) worldwide.
