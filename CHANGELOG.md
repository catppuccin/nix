## [1.2.1](https://github.com/catppuccin/nix/releases/tag/v1.2.1) - 2024-12-20

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- **home-manager/zed**: use correct names by [@isabelroses](https://github.com/isabelroses)

## [1.2.0](https://github.com/catppuccin/nix/releases/tag/v1.2.0) - 2024-12-20

This will (hopefully) be the final release before 2.0.0. In preparation for the next major release, our
modules have been moved to a standard `catppuccin` namespace (i.e., `programs.bat.catppuccin.enable` is now
`catppuccin.bat.enable`), but aliases to the old options remain for backwards compatibility. **These will be
removed in 2.0.0**
